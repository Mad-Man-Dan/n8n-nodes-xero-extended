## Installation

### For n8n Cloud users

This node is currently only available via installation on self-hosted instances. I will push to n8n-cloud via pull requests down the line to the base Xero node. However, so many changes and revisions have been done that the process would be time consuming for individual pull requests for the team to approve. I'll try to get to this some time in following month once I see about more additions.

### For self-hosted n8n users

To install a custom node in n8n, follow these steps:

- Refer to the official documentation: n8n Custom Node Installation (https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/)

- Choose the custom node you want to install, for example, n8n-nodes-xero-plus

- Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to install and configure the custom node.

- For detailed installation steps and configuration options, please visit the official n8n documentation linked above.

## Setup after installation

Similar to base Xero node:
1. Create a new Xero OAuth2 credential (you can't use the base Xero node as additional scopes are requested and needed for this node)
2. Select the resource/organisations you want to work with or accept all


## Credentials

This node uses a separate set of Xero OAuth2 credentials from the standard Xero node. The credentials created will also request additional scopes not in the original Xero base node. The scopes requested are as follows:

Previously the only scopes requested were: 	'offline_access', 'accounting.transactions', 'accounting.settings',	'accounting.contacts'

Now the following are requested in addition: 	'accounting.attachments',	'accounting.budgets.read',	'files',	'accounting.reports.read',
